N=8, FOURTH ORDER

The function is  (1-b)*(1-b*a)*(1-2*b*a*x*g+(b*a*x)^2)*(1-b*a*x*y)*(1-b*a*x*y*z)*(1-b*a*x*y*z*t)*(1-a)*(1-2*a*x*g+(a*x)^2)*(1-a*x*y)*(1-a*x*y*z)*(1-a*x*y*z*t)*(1-2*x*g+x^2)*(1-x*y)*(1-x*y*z)*(1-x*y*z*t)*(1-2*y*g+y^2)*(1-2*y*z*g+(y*z)^2)*(1-2*y*z*t*g+(y*z*t)^2)*(1-z)*(1-z*t)*(1-t)*2*sqrt(1-g^2).

We assume g >= 0 and we examine the 64 cases depending on the possible signs of the variables (b, a, x, y, z, t).

We represent the function as a graphical scheme. In every graphical scheme, the variables are positive and the sign information is seen in the sign in front of the variables, Rules are the following:

 + : it represents the factor (1-x_1 * ... * x_n )

 - : it represents the factor (1+x_1 * ... * x_n )

 +': it represents the factor (1 - 2*x_1 * ... * x_n*g +(x_1 * ... * x_n)^2 )

 -': it represents the factor (1 + 2*x_1 * ... * x_n*g +(x_1 * ... * x_n)^2 )

 R = (1-g^2)

 M = 3^(15/2)/4/7^(7/2)

             - 2R^(1/2)

Apply 3A to [(1,4),(1,5)], 1A to [(1,6)] and 5A to [(2,6),(3,6)]. These pieces together are <= 1.

Let F be the function we have to estimate.

Let P be the term corresponding to [(3,3),(3,4),(4,4)] multiplied by 2R^(1/2).
Let Q be the polynomial corresponding to [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,5),(5,6),(6,6)].
Then F <= P*Q.

Moreover,
Let T be the function corresponding to [(2,4),(2,5),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(4,4)] times the factor 2*R^(1/2),
let S1 be the polynomial corresponding to [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(2,3)]
and let S2 be the polynomial corresponding to [(4,5),(4,6),(5,5),(5,6),(6,6)]
Then F <= S1*S2*T.

We split the domain into two regions:

CASE 1: g in [3/10,3/4]^c  : in this case P <= 5                    (by 3Ebis)  and Q <= 16   (by 17G)
CASE 2: g in [3/10,3/4]    : in this case S1 and S2 both are <= 3.3 (by 1Hbis)  and T <= 7.15 (by 33G)

Therefore
max(F) <= max(5*16, 3.3^2*7.15) <= max(80, 78) <= 80.

Let F be the function we have to estimate.

Let P be the polynomial corresponding to positions [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)] (the first line and the
last column), i.e.,
P:=(1-x)*(1+x*y)*(1+2*x*y*z*g+(x*y*z)^2)*(1+x*y*z*t)*(1-x*y*z*t*a)*(1-x*y*z*t*a*b)*(1-y*z*t*a*b)*(1+z*t*a*b)*(1+2*t*a*b*g+(t*a*b)^2)*(1+a*b)*(1-b)

Let Q be the polynomial corresponding to positions [(2,2),(5,5)], i.e.,
Q:=(1+y)(1+a)

The remaining is <= 8 by 14G.

Thus, F <= PQ*8. We split the domain into two regions:

CASE 1: y OR  a in [0,1/2]: in this case P <= 8192/3125 (by 13G)     and Q <= 3 (evident)
CASE 2: y AND a in [1/2,1]: in this case P <= 2.14      (by 13Gbis)  and Q <= 4 (evident)

Therefore

This chamber is divided into two blocks.

Let F denote the function we have to estimate.
Let P be the function corresponding to [(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,6),(3,3),(3,4),(4,4),(4,5)] and multiplied by 2R^(1/2).
Let Q be the complementary polynomial, i.e. the one corresponding to [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,6),(2,2),(2,4),(2,5),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6),(5,5),(5,6),(6,6)]

Therefore F <= P*Q.

We split the domain into two regions according to the value of g.

CASE 1: g in [0,1/2]: in this case P <= 9.482 (by 22G)     and  Q <= 8.25  (by 21Gbis)
CASE 2: g in [1/2,1]: in this case P <= 8     (by 22Gbis)  and  Q <= 8.641 (by 21G)

Therefore
