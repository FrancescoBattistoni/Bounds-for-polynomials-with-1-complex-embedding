 We collect here all computations which are necessary to prove the bounds
 announced in " Maximum of polynomials and small regulators"
 http://arxiv....

 the archive is organized in the following way:

 bounds.txt                                                  contains the final bounds for every degree n and for each ordering

 bound for each camera n=6.gp    the final bounds for degree 6 for each ordering and for every configuration of signs in each ordering.
 bound for each camera n=7.gp    the final bounds for degree 7 for each ordering and for every configuration of signs in each ordering.
 bound for each camera n=8.gp    the final bounds for degree 8 for each ordering and for every configuration of signs in each ordering.
 bound for each camera n=9.gp    the final bounds for degree 9 for each ordering and for every configuration of signs in each ordering.

 The bounds are proved using several basic inequality. These inequalities and their proofs are in
